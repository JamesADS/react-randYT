You ever notice when you record a video most cameras will name the video accordingly within their file structure? I'm talking specifically about '####.EXT' where the extensions are usually .mp4 or .mov

Even if you didn't, thousands of these videos have found their way direct to Youtube, and act as a really fun grab bag of unscripted humanity.

Use RandYT to discover classics such as:

'1104.mp4'
'9229.mp4'
'1013.mp4'
